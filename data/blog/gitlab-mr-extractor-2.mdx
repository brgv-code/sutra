# Deep Dive into GitLab MR Extractor: Architecture and Implementation (Part 2)

After explaining why I built this tool in Part 1, let's get into the
nitty-gritty of how it actually works. Fair warning: this post contains actual
code and technical details. Grab your coffee.

## The Architecture

The library is built around three main components:

1. GitLab Client: Handles all API communications
2. Diff Parser: Processes the raw diff data
3. Merge Request Fetcher: Orchestrates the whole process

Here's what the flow looks like:

```typescript
// 1. Initialize the client

const client = new GitLabClient({
	baseUrl: 'https://gitlab.com',

	privateToken: 'your-token',

	projectId: '12345',
})

// 2. Create a fetcher

const fetcher = new MergeRequestFetcher(client)

// 3. Get the data

const mergeRequests = await fetcher.fetchAllMerged()
```

## The GitLab Client

The client is pretty straightforward. It's a wrapper around Axios that handles
the GitLab API:

```typescript

export class GitLabClient {

private readonly axiosInstance: AxiosInstance;

constructor(private config: GitLabConfig) {

this.axiosInstance = axios.create({

baseURL: config.baseUrl,

headers: {

'PRIVATE-TOKEN': config.privateToken

}

});

}

async getMergedMergeRequests(page = 1): Promise<ApiResponse<any[]>> {

return this.axiosInstance.get(

/api/v4/projects/${this.config.projectId}/merge_requests,

{

params: {

state: 'merged',

page,

per_page: 100
}});
}}
```

Nothing fancy here. Just basic API calls with proper error handling and
pagination support.

## The Diff Parser (The Cool Part)

This is where things get interesting. The diff parser takes raw Git diff output
and turns it into structured data. Here's a simplified version:

```typescript
export class DiffParser {
	private static readonly DIFF_LINE_REGEX = /^([+-])(.)/

	public static parse(rawDiff: string): DiffChange[] {
		const changes: DiffChange[] = []

		let lineNumber = 0

		const lines = rawDiff.split('\n')

		for (const line of lines) {
			if (!line) continue

			// Skip diff headers

			if (line.match(/^[+-] [^\s]/)) {
				continue
			}

			// Count unchanged lines

			if (line.startsWith(' ')) {
				lineNumber++

				continue
			}

			const match = this.DIFF_LINE_REGEX.exec(line)

			if (!match) {
				lineNumber++

				continue
			}

			const [, marker, content] = match

			changes.push({
				type: marker === '+' ? 'add' : 'delete',

				lineNumber: ++lineNumber,

				content: content,
			})
		}

		return changes
	}
}
```

The parser handles:

- Added lines (starting with +)

- Deleted lines (starting with -)

- Context lines (starting with space)

- Special cases like empty lines and diff headers

## Error Handling

One thing I learned the hard way: GitLab's API can be...unpredictable. So I
built a custom error system:

```typescript
export class GitLabApiError extends Error {
	constructor(
		message: string,

		public status?: number,
	) {
		super(message)

		this.name = 'GitLabApiError'
	}
}

export class DiffParsingError extends Error {
	constructor(message: string) {
		super(message)

		this.name = 'DiffParsingError'
	}
}
```

This makes error handling much cleaner:

```typescript
try {
	const mergeRequests = await fetcher.fetchAllMerged()
} catch (error) {
	if (error instanceof GitLabApiError) {
		console.error('API Error:', error.status)
	} else if (error instanceof DiffParsingError) {
		console.error('Diff Parsing Failed:', error.message)
	}
}
```

## Testing

I'm a big fan of testing, so I added comprehensive tests using Jest:

```typescript
describe('DiffParser', () => {
	it('should parse added lines', () => {
		const diff = '+new line\n regular line\n+another new line'

		const changes = DiffParser.parse(diff)

		expect(changes).toHaveLength(2)

		expect(changes[0].type).toBe('add')

		expect(changes[0].content).toBe('new line')
	})

	// More tests...
})
```

## What I Learned

Building this parser taught me a few things:

1. Git diffs are more complex than they look
2. Regular expressions are both powerful and dangerous
3. Type safety in TypeScript is a lifesaver
4. Good error handling makes debugging much easier

## Coming Up Next

In Part 3, we'll look at:

- Advanced usage patterns
- Real-world examples
- Performance optimizations
- Future features (spoiler: AI-powered diff analysis!)

Stay tuned!
