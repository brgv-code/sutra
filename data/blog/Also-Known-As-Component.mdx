A small but impactful update was made to our Also Known As component to improve
its visual consistency. The change removes unnecessary padding that was creating
extra space for companies with AKA entries.

## The Issue

Previously, our `AlsoKnownAsIcon` component had hardcoded padding that was
applying the same spacing regardless of whether it was being used for company
names or URLs:

```typescript
export const AlsoKnownAsIcon = styled('div', {
	shouldForwardProp: prop => prop !== 'editable' && prop !== 'field',
})<IconProps>`
	padding: ${({ field }) =>
		field === 'alsoKnownAsNames' ? '12px 8px 0px 6px' : '12px 8px 0px 6px'};
	position: sticky;
	bottom: 0;
	align-self: flex-end;
`
```

The conditional padding was redundant since both cases were using the same
values (`12px 8px 0px 6px`). Additionally, this extra padding was creating
unnecessary space around the AKA entries.

## The Solution

We simplified the component by:

1. Removing the unnecessary `field` prop from the `AlsoKnownAsIcon` component
2. Eliminating the redundant padding condition
3. Keeping the essential positioning properties

Here's the cleaned-up version:

```typescript
interface IconProps {
	editable: boolean
}

export const AlsoKnownAsIcon = styled('div', {
	shouldForwardProp: prop => prop !== 'editable' && prop !== 'field',
})<IconProps>`
	position: sticky;
	bottom: 0;
	align-self: flex-end;
`
```

The component usage was also simplified:

```typescript
<AlsoKnownAsIcon editable={false}>
  <XChevronDownStyled />
</AlsoKnownAsIcon>
```

## Impact

This change:

- Creates a more consistent visual appearance across the application
- Removes unnecessary code complexity
- Improves maintainability by eliminating redundant styling logic
- Provides a cleaner, more compact layout for companies with AKA entries

While this might seem like a minor change, it's these kinds of refinements that
contribute to a polished, professional user interface. The removal of
unnecessary padding ensures that our AKA component aligns better with our
overall design system while maintaining its functionality.
