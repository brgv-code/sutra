We recently made a change to disable Sentry error monitoring and source maps in
local development. This prevents unnecessary notifications while ensuring that
error tracking remains effective in production.

## Key Changes

### Disabling Sentry in Development

Sentry error reporting has been disabled in local development by adding a
condition to the initialization script:

- Prevents unnecessary error notifications during local development.
- Ensures that Sentry is only enabled in production environments.

### Updating Deprecated Plugins

We replaced deprecated Sentry plugins:

- **`Replay()` → `replayIntegration()`**
- **`BrowserTracing()` → `browserTracingIntegration()`**

This update ensures compatibility with the latest Sentry API while maintaining
proper tracing and error reporting functionality.

### Merging Duplicate Sentry Initialization

Previously, Sentry was being initialized in multiple places. We merged the
initialization logic into `sentry.client.config.ts`, streamlining the
configuration and reducing redundant code.

## Implementation Details

### Updating `_app.tsx`

The redundant Sentry initialization was removed from `_app.tsx`:

```diff
-    Sentry.init({
-      ...SENTRY_CONFIG,
-      integrations: [new Sentry.BrowserTracing()]
-    })
```

Now, Sentry initialization happens centrally in `sentry.client.config.ts`.

### Updating `sentry.client.config.ts`

We replaced the deprecated functions and ensured Sentry is disabled in
development:

```typescript
import * as Sentry from '@sentry/nextjs'
import { FRONTEND_ENV } from 'configs/loura.next.constants'
import { SENTRY_CONFIG } from 'sentry.client.config'

Sentry.init({
	...SENTRY_CONFIG,
	dsn: 'https://d7d34627939d3cf0295b2d4136366230@sentry.foundamentals.io/2',
	integrations: [
		Sentry.replayIntegration({ maskAllText: true, blockAllMedia: true }),
		Sentry.browserTracingIntegration(),
	],
	enabled: FRONTEND_ENV !== 'development',
})
```

This ensures that:

- The latest integrations are used.
- Sentry is only active in non-development environments.

### Updating `next.config.js`

A minor cleanup was performed by removing an unnecessary blank line.

```diff
-\n //@ts-check
```

This doesn’t impact functionality but helps maintain clean code.
