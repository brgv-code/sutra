In this post, we’ll take a look at a recent merge request (MR) that addresses an
issue with user avatars in the Loura application. The goal of this MR is to
ensure that the chat avatars for inactive users are displayed correctly based on
their active status.

## Overview of the Changes

The MR introduces a couple of changes in the GraphQL queries and the React hooks
used to load users. Here’s a breakdown of what was modified:

### 1. GraphQL Query Update

The first significant change is in the GraphQL query used to fetch team users.
Previously, the query did not account for the active status of users. The
updated query now includes an additional parameter for `active`, allowing us to
filter users based on their active status.

Here’s the relevant part of the code that was changed:

```graphql

query allTeamUsersQuery($page: Int, $pageSize: Int, $teamId: UUID!, $active: Boolean) {
users(page: $page, pageSize: $pageSize, teamId: $teamId, active: $active) {
id
firstName
lastName
}
}
```

### 2. Hook Modification

The second change is in the `useLoadUsers` hook. This hook is responsible for
loading the users when the component mounts. The modification ensures that when
we call the `getTeamUsers` function, we pass the `active` parameter as `false`
by default. This means that when the component loads, it will fetch all users,
regardless of their active status.

Here’s the updated part of the hook:

```javascript
const currentTeamIDReactive = useReactiveVar(currentTeamID)

useEffect(() => {
	if (!currentTeamIDReactive) return

	if (!isEmpty(userListReactive)) return

	if (getTeamUsersState.loading) return

	getTeamUsers({
		variables: {
			page: 0,
			pageSize: 50,
			teamId: currentTeamIDReactive,
			active: false,
		},
	})
}, [
	currentTeamIDReactive,
	getTeamUsers,
	getTeamUsersState.loading,
	userListReactive,
])
```

## Testing the Changes

To ensure that the changes work as intended, a few tests were conducted:

1. **Inactive Users**: When the `active` parameter is set to `false`, all users
   are returned. This allows the chat avatars for inactive users to be displayed
   correctly.
2. **Active Users**: When the `active` parameter is set to `true`, the chat
   avatars for inactive users will default to that of the current user.

## Conclusion

This MR is a straightforward yet essential update that improves the user
experience in the Loura application. By ensuring that inactive users are
represented correctly in the chat, we enhance the overall functionality of the
platform.
