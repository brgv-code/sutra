In this post, Iâ€™ll cover the recent changes made to add components for the
`PersonalProfile`, `MyNotifications`, and `MySettings` sections in our
application. The goal was to enhance user interaction and provide a more
cohesive experience.

## Design Philosophy

### Modular and Reusable Structure

The design philosophy behind these components was to create a modular and
reusable structure that allows for easy management of user settings and
notifications.

```tsx
const NotificationWrapper = ({
	label,
	description,
	onChangeHandler,
	value,
}) => {
	return (
		<div>
			<label>{label}</label>

			<input type='checkbox' checked={value} onChange={onChangeHandler} />

			<p>{description}</p>
		</div>
	)
}
```

This modular approach simplifies the codebase and promotes maintainability.

### User-Centric Features

The `NotificationWrapper` component provides a clear interface for users to
toggle their notification settings. This approach improves usability and
empowers users to customize their experience.

### Integration and Consistency

Integrating these components into the existing `MySettings` section required
careful consideration of the overall layout and design.

```tsx
<MySettings>
	<NotificationWrapper
		label='Enable Notifications'
		description='Receive updates via email.'
		onChangeHandler={handleToggle}
		value={notificationsEnabled}
	/>
</MySettings>
```

This ensures that the new components align with the established design patterns
in the application.

## Conclusion

Overall, the addition of the new personal profile components enhances the user
experience by providing clear feedback and improving the visual appeal of the
application. I welcome any feedback or suggestions from the team. If you have
thoughts or ideas, feel free to reach out. Happy coding!
