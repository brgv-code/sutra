In this post, Iâ€™ll cover the changes I made to add empty state components to the
Reminders and Search List pages in our application. The goal was to provide
users with clear visual feedback when there are no reminders or search results
available. Hereâ€™s a detailed look at what I did, the reasoning behind my
approach, and the challenges I faced.

## Overview of Changes

The main change was to implement empty state components that display a message
and an icon when there are no reminders or search results. This helps users
understand that the absence of items is expected and not an error.

### Implementing Empty States in Reminders

In the `RemindersList` component, I replaced the previous empty state text with
a more engaging empty state component. Hereâ€™s the relevant code snippet:

```typescript
 ifÂ (!remindersLoadingÂ && !sortedReminders?.length) {

returnÂ (

<EmptyTextDiv>

<IconWrapper>

<StyledReminderIcon />

</IconWrapper>

<EmptyText>{YouÂ don'tÂ haveÂ anyÂ remindersÂ ðŸ¤“Â }</EmptyText>

</EmptyTextDiv>

);

}
```

This change enhances the user interface by providing a visual cue (the reminder
icon) along with a friendly message. Itâ€™s important to create a welcoming
experience, especially when users might feel discouraged by an empty list.

### Updating the Search List Component

Similarly, in the `SearchList` component, I implemented an empty state for when
no search results are found:

```tsx
if (!renderedSearchEntries?.length && sentSearchTermReactive.length) {
	return (
		<EmptyTextDiv>
			<IconWrapper>
				<StyledSearchIcon />
			</IconWrapper>

			<EmptyText> {'searchÂ queryÂ did notÂ return anyÂ results'}</EmptyText>
		</EmptyTextDiv>
	)
}
```

This approach provides users with immediate feedback about their search query,
helping them understand that the lack of results is due to their input rather
than a malfunction in the application.

### Styling the Empty State Components

To support these new empty state components, I reused the styled components
created earlier. This consistency in design helps maintain a cohesive look
across different parts of the application.

## Why This Approach?

The main goal was to enhance user experience by providing clear feedback when
there are no reminders or search results. Users often feel lost when they
encounter empty states without context. By implementing these empty state
components, I aimed to reduce confusion and improve the overall usability of the
application.

## Challenges Faced

One challenge was ensuring that the new empty state components integrated well
with existing functionality. I had to be careful to maintain the overall layout
and design while introducing new elements. Additionally, testing the new
components across different scenarios took time to ensure they displayed
correctly under various conditions.

## Conclusion

Overall, Iâ€™m satisfied with the addition of empty state components in the
Reminders and Search List pages. They enhance the user experience by providing
clear feedback and improving the visual appeal of the application. As always, I
welcome any feedback or suggestions from the team. If you have thoughts or
ideas, feel free to reach out. Happy coding!
