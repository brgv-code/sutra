We recently enhanced our similar companies feature by adding the ability to delete first-order similar companies and made several UI improvements. This update gives users more control over their company relationships while improving the overall user experience.

## Key Changes

### Delete Functionality
The most significant addition is the ability to delete first-order similar companies. We've implemented this carefully to ensure that:
- Only first-degree similar companies can be deleted
- Deletion happens one company at a time
- The UI updates immediately while the backend processes the deletion
- Users receive feedback via a snackbar notification

### UI Improvements
We've made several visual enhancements:
- The plus icon no longer appears for first-degree similar companies
- Updated button hover states for both plus and delete icons
- Improved the reload button styling with better spacing and color scheme
- Reorganized the similar companies layout using a new `SimilarCompaniesBox` component

### Code Architecture Updates

#### State Management
We introduced new state management features:
```typescript
// New reactive variable for tracking reload state
export const similarCompanyReload = makeVar<boolean>(false)

// Local state for tracking deleted companies
const [deletedCompanyIds, setDeletedCompanyIds] = useState<Set<string>>(new Set())
```

#### Delete Operation Implementation
We added a new GraphQL mutation for removing similar companies:
```graphql
mutation removeSimilarCompany($companyId: UUID!, $similarCompanyId: UUID!) {
  removeSimilarCompany(companyId: $companyId, similarCompanyId: $similarCompanyId) {
    id
  }
}
```

The deletion process includes optimistic updates to provide immediate feedback:
```typescript
const handleDeleteSimilarCompanies = useCallback(
  (companyIdGiven: string) => {
    // Show notification
    snackState({
      message: "Deleting similar company",
      severity: "info",
      open: true,
      autoHideDuration: 10000
    })

    // Update local state
    setDeletedCompanyIds((prev) => new Set([...prev, companyIdGiven]))

    // Filter the companies list
    if (similarCompaniesReactive) {
      const filteredCompanies = similarCompaniesReactive.filter(
        (company) =>
          company.id !== companyIdGiven && company.tracxnId !== companyIdGiven
      )
      similarCompanies(filteredCompanies)
    }

    // Call the backend
    removeSimilarCompany(companyId, companyIdGiven)
  },
  [removeSimilarCompany, companyID, similarCompaniesReactive]
)
```

### Visual Components
The delete button appears as a trash icon for first-degree similar companies:
```typescript
{degree === 1 ? (
  <DegreeButton
    onClick={(e) => {
      e.stopPropagation()
      handleDeleteSimilarCompanies(company.id)
    }}
  >
    <ThinTrash2 />
  </DegreeButton>
) : null}
```

## Testing Considerations
The implementation includes several key testing scenarios:
- Verifying that delete operations only work on first-degree similar companies
- Ensuring the UI updates immediately after deletion
- Confirming that the backend successfully processes the deletion
- Testing the notification system for user feedback
- Verifying that the company list updates correctly after deletion

## Next Steps
While this update significantly improves the similar companies feature, there are a few potential enhancements we could consider:
- Batch deletion capability
- Undo deletion functionality
- Additional filtering options for similar companies
- Enhanced visual feedback during deletion operations

These changes provide users with more control over their similar companies while maintaining a clean and intuitive interface.
