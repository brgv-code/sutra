In this post, I’ll discuss the recent updates made to the `FounderModal`
component. The goal was to improve the design and functionality of the modal
based on the specifications provided in Figma. This enhancement is not just
about aesthetics; it’s about creating a more intuitive and user-friendly
experience for our users.

## Design Choices and Enhancements

### User-Centric Design

The primary focus of this update was to create a more user-friendly and visually
appealing modal. By utilizing Material-UI's `Modal` component, I ensured that
the modal behaves consistently across different devices and screen sizes.

```tsx
import { Modal } from '@mui/material'

;<Modal open={isOpen} onClose={handleClose}>
	<div className='modal-content'>{/ Modal content goes here /}</div>
</Modal>
```

This choice enhances the user experience by providing a familiar interface that
users can easily navigate.

### Visual Consistency

To maintain visual consistency with the rest of the application, I updated the
modal's styling. This included adjusting the padding, border radius, and box
shadow.

```tsx
const StyledModal = styled(Box) 
padding: 20px; 
border-radius: 10px; 
box-shadow: 0px 4px 20px rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.1);
```

This ensures that the modal's appearance is cohesive with other UI elements.

### User Interaction

Improving user interaction within the modal was another key focus. I implemented
clear button states and hover effects to provide immediate feedback to users.

```tsx
<Button variant='contained' onClick={handleSubmit}>
	Submit
</Button>
```

This attention to detail helps users understand their actions and enhances the
overall usability of the component.

## Conclusion

Overall, the enhancements made to the `FounderModal` component significantly
improve the user experience. By focusing on design consistency, user
interaction, and accessibility, I believe the modal now better serves its
purpose within the application. I welcome any feedback or suggestions from the
team. If you have thoughts or ideas, feel free to reach out. Happy coding!
