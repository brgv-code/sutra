# From One-Way Blog to Interactive Community: Why I Chose Giscus for Developer Comments

## The Problem: When Your Blog Becomes a Dead End

After building the core features of my [portfolio](https://bhargav.dev) website
markdown support, different sections, clean design, I had to stop working on the
project to focus on work and my university thesis. But one thing always stuck in
my mind: **I didn't want my blog to be one-directional**.

You know the feeling. People read your content, and if they want to discuss
something, they have to hunt down your email, search for your social media
handles, or just... give up. It happend with me with most of the personal blogs
I read and I got a few queries like that, and it feel good me every time.

I wanted my blog to be interactive. I wanted people to discuss the content,
whether I was right or wrong, if something could be done better. Most
importantly, I wanted every individual post to have its own discussion,
abstracted from others.

## My First Attempt: The Custom Solution Trap

Without any research (rookie mistake), I spun up a PostgreSQL database instance
and started building a comment component from scratch. User authentication,
comment storage, moderation, spam prevention, the whole nine yards.

Then reality hit. Work deadlines, thesis pressure, and the complexity of
building a robust comment system made me abandon the project entirely.

Sound familiar? Here's what I was signing up for:

- **Database management**: Comments, users, sessions, replies
- **Authentication system**: User registration, login, password resets
- **Spam prevention**: Manual moderation, filtering algorithms
- **Security concerns**: SQL injection, XSS attacks, data breaches
- **Backup strategies**: What happens when the database fails?
- **Scaling issues**: What if a post goes viral?

For a simple portfolio blog, this was overkill.

## The Discovery: How TkDodo's Blog Changed Everything

Fast forward to recently. I was reading
[TkDodo's excellent blog on React Query](https://tkdodo.eu/blog/react-query-selectors-supercharged),
diving deep into React Query Selectors, when I scrolled to the comments section.

![[images/Screenshot 2025-08-13 at 14.05.20.png]] I liked how the comments
looked clean, professional, and integrated seamlessly with the design. But I
didn't see any sign-in buttons on the blog, registration forms, or the typical
comment system bloat. Yet there were active discussions, threaded replies, and
what looked like real developer engagement.

Questions immediately popped into my head:

- How is he handling data transfer?
- How are user profiles enabled without a sign-in function?
- Where is this data being stored?

Then I saw it: "powered by giscus" written in small letters at the bottom.

Following the trail led me to the
[giscus GitHub page](https://github.com/giscus/giscus), and it checked all my
boxes. But I'm a thorough developer, so I researched the alternatives.

## Why Giscus Over the Alternatives

Utterences and Discus were the alternatives that I could find. I wasn't the only
developer facing this decision. Jake Lee documented
his¬†[migration from Utterances to Giscus](https://blog.jakelee.co.uk/migrating-from-utterances-to-giscus-comments/),
highlighting that giscus uses GitHub Discussions instead of Issues and supports
threaded replies. Rob
Hyndman¬†[migrated from Disqus](https://robjhyndman.com/hyndsight/disqus2giscus.html)¬†citing
giscus's lightweight nature and lack of tracking. As the creator of giscus
writes in his blog GitHub Discussions are designed specifically for
conversations, making them the natural choice for blog comments. As per a custom
solution goes, I wanted to finish my project and not reinvent the wheel by
building a comment system from scratch.

## Implementation: From Idea to Working Comments

Here's exactly how I implemented giscus on my portfolio:

### Step 1: Repository Setup

1. **Enable GitHub Discussions** on your repository:
   - Go to `https://github.com/your-username/your-repo/settings`
   - Scroll to "Features" section
   - Check "Discussions" ![[images/Screenshot 2025-08-13 at 14.13.30.png]]
1. **Create a comment category** (optional but recommended):
   - Go to your repository's Discussions tab
   - Create a new category called "Blog Comments"
   - Set it as the default for new discussions

### Step 2: Giscus Configuration

1. **Install the Giscus app** on your repository:

   - Visit [giscus.app](https://giscus.app)
   - Connect your GitHub account
   - Select your repository

2. **Configure your preferences**:

   ```
   Repository: your-username/your-repo
   Page ‚ÜîÔ∏è Discussions Mapping: Discussion title contains page pathname
   Discussion Category: Blog Comments (or General)
   Features: ‚úÖ Enable reactions, ‚úÖ Emit discussion metadata
   Theme: Choose based on your site design
   ```

3. **Copy the generated script tag** - you'll need this for integration.

### Step 3: React Component Implementation (15 minutes)

Giscus also has a react component which you can just plug into your project
along with teh correct environment variables or the setup script. Here's the
React component I built for my Next.js portfolio:

```tsx
'use client'

import Giscus from '@giscus/react'

interface GiscusCommentsProps {
	slug: string

	title: string

	className?: string
}

export default function GiscusComments({
	slug,
	title,
	className = '',
}: GiscusCommentsProps) {
	return (
		<section
			className={`comments-section mt-8 md:mt-12 ${className}`}
			aria-label={`Comments for ${title}`}
		>
			<div className='border border-white/10 rounded-xl p-5 md:p-6 shadow-xl bg-gray-900/40 backdrop-blur-sm'>
				<div className='mb-4'>
					<h3 className='text-xl font-mono font-bold text-white mb-2'>
						üí¨ Comments
					</h3>
				</div>

				<Giscus
					id='comments'
					repo={
						(process.env.NEXT_PUBLIC_GISCUS_REPO as `${string}/${string}`) ||
						'brgv-code/sutra'
					}
					repoId={process.env.NEXT_PUBLIC_GISCUS_REPO_ID || ''}
					category={process.env.NEXT_PUBLIC_GISCUS_CATEGORY || 'Announcements'}
					categoryId={process.env.NEXT_PUBLIC_GISCUS_CATEGORY_ID || ''}
					mapping='pathname'
					strict='0'
					reactionsEnabled='1'
					emitMetadata='1'
					inputPosition='bottom'
					theme='transparent_dark'
					lang='en'
					loading='lazy'
				/>
			</div>
		</section>
	)
}
```

### Step 4: Environment Variables

Create a `.env.local` file with your giscus configuration:

```env
NEXT_PUBLIC_GISCUS_REPO=your-username/your-repo
NEXT_PUBLIC_GISCUS_REPO_ID=your_repo_id_from_giscus_app
NEXT_PUBLIC_GISCUS_CATEGORY=Blog Comments
NEXT_PUBLIC_GISCUS_CATEGORY_ID=your_category_id_from_giscus_app
```

You can get these values from the [giscus.app](https://giscus.app) configuration
page.

### Step 5: Integration with Blog Posts

In your blog post component:

```tsx
import GiscusComments from '@/components/GiscusComments'

export default function BlogPost({ params }: { params: { slug: string } }) {
	const post = getPostBySlug(params.slug)

	return (
		<article className='max-w-4xl mx-auto px-4 py-8'>
			<header className='mb-8'>
				<h1 className='text-3xl font-bold mb-4'>{post.title}</h1>
				<time className='text-gray-600'>{post.date}</time>
			</header>

			<div
				className='prose dark:prose-invert max-w-none'
				dangerouslySetInnerHTML={{ __html: post.content }}
			/>

			{/* Comments Section */}
			<GiscusComments slug={params.slug} title={post.title} className='mt-12' />
		</article>
	)
}
```

## What I Learned: The Benefits in Practice

![[images/Screenshot 2025-08-12 at 21.33.28.png]] After implementing giscus,
here's what actually happened:

### For Readers

- **Zero friction**: No new accounts to create
- **Familiar interface**: GitHub's discussion UI they already know
- **Professional identity**: Comments tied to their GitHub profile
- **Rich formatting**: Full markdown support with syntax highlighting
- **Proper notifications**: GitHub's notification system actually works

### For Me as a Developer

- **Zero maintenance**: No database to manage or backup
- **Built-in moderation**: GitHub's spam detection and user blocking
- **Version controlled comments**: All discussions backed up in Git
- **Professional discussions**: Higher quality conversations from verified
  developers
- **No vendor lock-in**: If I ever want to migrate, all data stays in my repo

### Performance Impact

- **Lazy loading**: Comments only load when users scroll to them
- **Small bundle**: Minimal JavaScript footprint
- **CDN delivery**: Served from GitHub's global infrastructure
- **No database queries**: Zero impact on my site's response time

## Common Issues and Solutions

### Issue 1: "Discussion Not Found"

**Problem**: Category mismatch between giscus config and GitHub repository.

**Solution**: Double-check that your category name in environment variables
exactly matches what you created in GitHub Discussions.

### Issue 2: Comments Not Loading

**Troubleshooting checklist**:

- [ ] Repository is public
- [ ] Discussions are enabled in repository settings
- [ ] Giscus app is installed on your repository
- [ ] Environment variables are correctly set
- [ ] No console errors in browser dev tools

### Issue 3: Theme Not Matching

**Problem**: Giscus theme doesn't match your site's dark/light mode.

**Solution**: Use `preferred_color_scheme` for automatic theme switching, or
implement dynamic theme changing:

```tsx
// Dynamic theme switching
const theme = isDarkMode ? 'dark' : 'light'
script.setAttribute('data-theme', theme)
```

## Final Thoughts

What started as a need for basic interactivity turned into discovering the
perfect solution for developer blogs. Giscus eliminates all the complexity of
traditional comment systems while providing a superior experience for both
readers and content creators.

If you're building a developer blog and want comments that your audience will
actually use, give giscus a try. Your future self (and your readers) will thank
you.
